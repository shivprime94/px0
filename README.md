# px0

px0 is a fast, ultra-light, remote-first, read-only IDE designed for instant code navigation and review in your browser. Booting in under 1 ms and using ~20 MB of RAM, it turns your browser into a zero-latency inspection console with symbol-level navigation, deep search, and syntax highlighting across massive codebases.

## Optimized for Reads

More and more code generation happens directly in the terminal—driven by coding agents, CLI tools, and background orchestrators. Developers spend significantly less time typing boilerplate and more time reviewing, auditing, and navigating.

Because speed of access is everything when inspecting code, **px0 is obsessively optimized for reads and never edits your source.** The only thing it writes is review comments, kept in a `.px0/` sidecar directory (see [Review Comments](#review-comments-for-your-agent) below); your tracked files are never touched. You don't need a heavy editing environment with background extension churn just to verify code; you need a sub-millisecond, zero-latency window into the repository, especially across remote machines.

### Where px0 fits in best:

- **Verifying AI Agent Output**: Trace symbol references, inspect live git diffs against `HEAD`, review generated code, and close the tab without leaving your terminal flow.
- **Remote & Cloud Server Inspection**: Spin up on any remote server, VM, or CI runner and browse the codebase instantly from your local browser—no SSH keys, no port forwarding hassle, and no heavy remote desktop/daemons.
- **Auditing Large Repositories**: Read through massive, 50,000+ file codebases on a laptop without background indexers hogging RAM or spinning up fans.
- **Sidecar to Terminal Editors**: Keep lightweight editors (like Vim, Neovim, or Helix) in the terminal for typing, while using px0 as a high-density, rich graphical inspection and diff console.

## Review Comments for Your Agent

Stop copy-pasting code into your agent to explain what to change. Review in px0, mark up the lines that need work, and hand your agent the comments.

1. **Select code** in any file (or the diff view) and press `Alt+K` (or click **Comment** in the selection toolbar). Type a note and save with `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`.
2. Commented lines get a **gutter marker**; the **Comments** tab in the right inspector lists every open comment, jumps to any of them, and has a one-click **Copy agent instruction** button.
3. Comments are stored locally in `.px0/` and rendered to **`.px0/review.md`**, a self-contained file with each comment's id, location, the exact code snippet, and a `STALE` flag if the code has since moved:

   ```markdown
   ## [c1] server.go:64
   ```go
   s.mux.HandleFunc("/api/diff", s.handleDiff)
   ```
   rename handleDiff → handleGitDiff
   ```

4. Point your agent at it: *"Read `.px0/review.md` and apply every open comment. After each, run `px0 resolve <id>`."* As the agent resolves comments, the px0 UI **checks them off live**.

Agent-facing commands (no server required):

```bash
px0 review          # print open comments (review.md) to stdout
px0 review --json   # same, as JSON
px0 resolve <id>    # mark a comment resolved
```

`.px0/` is kept out of git automatically (added to the repo's `.git/info/exclude`), so review notes stay local to you.

## Installation

### Quick Install (macOS, Linux, BSD)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://px0.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### Build from Source

Requires Go 1.24+. No npm, node, CGO, or external dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/px0-ai/px0.git
cd px0
make build
install -d ~/.local/bin && install px0 ~/.local/bin/
```

To cross-compile binaries for all supported platforms:

```bash
make dist
```

## Features

- **Blazing Fast Navigation**: Fuzzy file search (`Cmd/Ctrl+P`), symbol outline (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O`), and workspace regex search (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F`) in milliseconds.
- **Remote-First, Zero SSH Hassle**: Spin up on any remote server, cloud instance, or runner in < 1 ms. Inspect remote code in your local browser over a single port (Tailscale, WireGuard, reverse proxy, or tunnel) without SSH key setups, port forwarding churn, or remote extension daemons.
- **Rich Syntax Highlighting**: Native tokenization for ~280 languages via Chroma with windowed rendering.
- **Git Awareness & Visual Diffs**: Status badges (`M`, `A`, `D`, `U`, `R`), dirty folder ancestry propagation, changed-files filter, and side-by-side / unified diffs vs `HEAD` (`Cmd/Ctrl+D`).
- **Rendered Markdown Preview**: Full GFM preview with Chroma-highlighted code fences; switch between preview and source with `Alt+M` while preserving scroll.
- **Custom Themes**: 14 built-in themes (Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Dracula, GitHub Dark, Gruvbox, Nord, Solarized, and more).
- **Optional Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Zero-config auto-detection (`gopls`, `rust-analyzer`, `pyright`, `typescript-language-server`, `clangd`) for Go-to-Definition (`F12`), Hover, references, and call trails. Falls back automatically to regex outlines.
- **Virtual DOM / Zero Overhead**: Opening a 400,000-line file costs the same as a 10-line file; only visible rows are mounted. Reclaims memory after 15 seconds of inactivity.
- **Completely Self-Contained**: Single static binary embedding all web assets. Zero runtime dependencies, no Electron, no Node, no cloud phone-homes.

## Language Server (LSP) Setup (Optional)

`px0` works fully out of the box without language servers using built-in fuzzy search and regex outlines.

When installed, language servers provide semantic Go-to-Definition (`F12`), hover types/docs, and call trails. px0 auto-detects servers on your `PATH` or standard install directories:

| Language | Server | Quick Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | `gopls` | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` | `rustup component add rust-analyzer` |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| Python | `pyright` / `pylsp` / `ruff` | `npm install -g pyright` or `pipx install python-lsp-server` |
| C / C++ | `clangd` | `sudo apt install clangd` or `brew install llvm` |
| Zig | `zls` | `brew install zls` or [zigtools/zls](https://github.com/zigtools/zls) |
| Lua | `lua-language-server` | `brew install lua-language-server` |
| Ruby | `solargraph` | `gem install solargraph` |
| Java | `jdtls` | `brew install jdtls` |
| C# | `omnisharp` | Install OmniSharp on `PATH` |
| LaTeX | `texlab` | `brew install texlab` |

Servers spawn lazily on first request and shut down cleanly upon exit. Disable with `px0 -no-lsp`. You can also click **LSP: set up** in the status bar to view or trigger automatic installation for your OS.

## Why a Dedicated Code Viewer?

Traditional IDEs carry tens of thousands of authoring features, Electron runtimes, background indexers, and gigabytes of memory overhead. In modern AI-assisted workflows, developers spend significantly more time reviewing code than typing it.

| Parameter | Traditional IDE (e.g., VS Code) | px0 (Code Viewer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Purpose | Manual code authoring & plugin host | Instant code reading & navigation |
| Base Memory (RSS) | ~1,440 MB (1.4+ GB) | ~20 MB (~70x lighter) |
| Active Startup CPU Spike | 35% - 50% | < 1% |
| Cold Startup Time | Several seconds | Sub-millisecond |
| Process Tree | 15+ Node.js/Electron processes | 1 single static Go binary |
| Workspace Indexing | Multi-second background churn | 0 - 45 ms for entire repositories |
| Setup and Config | Config files, plugins, node, npm | Zero config, zero runtime |

## Key Numbers and Benchmarks

All metrics are measured on real-world repositories and reproducible using [`./benchmark.sh`](benchmark.sh).

```

## Usage

Run `px0` with an optional file or directory:

```bash
px0                     # view current workspace
px0 ~/src/kernel        # view another repository
px0 web/src/main.js     # view a file in its project workspace
px0 main.go:42          # open directly to a line number
```

### Remote & Cloud Workspaces

Spin up on any remote server, VM, or container and view code directly in your local browser without SSH shell management, X11 forwarding, or remote extension daemons:

```bash
# Bind all interfaces on a remote machine / cloud instance
px0 -host 0.0.0.0 -port 7777 ~/work/repo

# Headless / server mode without opening local browser
px0 -no-open -port 8080 /workspace

# In Docker / CI runner
docker run -p 7777:7777 -v $(pwd):/src px0:latest
```

Access securely over Tailscale, WireGuard, reverse proxy, or Cloudflare Tunnel with zero remote setup overhead and strict read-only sandboxing (path traversal protection & DNS rebinding checks).

### Updating px0

To check for updates and automatically upgrade `px0` to the latest release:

```bash
px0 --update
```

`px0` also checks asynchronously in the background once every 24 hours without delaying startup (<1 ms) and notifies you on stderr when an update is available.

## Philosophy and Design Principles

- **Optimized for Reads**: px0 does not attempt to be a heavy code editor. Code authoring belongs to AI agents, CLI tools, or dedicated editors. px0 focuses exclusively on the reader experience with zero write endpoints.
- **Remote-First & SSH-Free**: Works seamlessly whether inspecting a local directory or a cloud instance over Tailscale/VPN—no remote daemons, no X11 forwarding, and no SSH session maintenance.
- **Private & Sandboxed**: Zero accounts, zero cloud dependencies. Code and queries stay on the running machine. Protected by path traversal guards and DNS rebinding prevention.
- **Reclaims Memory**: Automatically recovers memory after 15 seconds of inactivity so idle sessions don't hoard host RAM.

### Telemetry & Privacy

px0 collects lightweight, anonymous backend session metrics (via PostHog) strictly to calculate DAU/MAU and session duration (start time and stop time).

**What is NEVER collected:**
- No feature interactions, user actions, or command activity
- No frontend events, browser fingerprinting, or client trackers
- No code snippets, file contents, or diffs
- No file names, directory paths, or repository names
- No symbol names, function signatures, or search queries
- No personal data or user accounts

**How to opt out:**
You can disable telemetry completely at any time through any of the following:
- CLI flag: `px0 -no-telemetry`
- Environment variable: `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `export PX0_TELEMETRY=0`


## Reproducing Benchmarks

All benchmark figures can be measured directly on your own system:

```bash
# 1. Fetch benchmark corpus (~3 GB shallow clones of Linux, K8s, TypeScript, etc.)
./benchmark.sh --clone

# 2. Run the full benchmark suite
./benchmark.sh

# 3. Compare px0 directly against VS Code process tree on your workspace
./benchmark.sh --vscode .

# 4. Profile memory lifecycle across index, search, and idle recovery
./benchmark.sh --memory bench-repos/linux

# 5. Measure LSP latency (definition, hover, references)
./benchmark.sh --lsp .
```

See [Performance Benchmarks](BENCHMARKS.md) for full methodology and detailed charts.

### Architecture & Internals

For comprehensive technical deep-dives into the architecture, indexing, virtualized rendering, syntax highlighting, and LSP subsystems, see the [Internals Documentation](docs/internals/README.md).

- `main.go` / `ui.go`: CLI entrypoint, flag parsing, signal management, Ape terminal experience.
- `update.go`: Self-updater and asynchronous daily version check.
- `server.go`: HTTP routes, JSON API, gzip compression, and embedded asset serving.
- `index.go`: Concurrently walks workspace, honors `.gitignore` (ignored files stay visible but dimmed in the explorer, and are never indexed or searched), builds in-memory path and trie structures in milliseconds.
- `search.go` / `fuzzy.go`: High-performance substring and fuzzy file/symbol matching algorithms.
- `lsp.go` / `lspnav.go` / `calls.go`: Lightweight JSON-RPC client communicating with local language servers over stdio, plus definitions, references and call trails.
- `lspservers.go` / `lspsetup.go`: Language server registry, discovery, and install on request.
- `web/`: Native zero-dependency ES module frontend (custom virtual scroll, syntax highlight rendering, tab manager).
- `web/themes/`: One CSS file per colour theme, joined by the server into `/static/themes.css`. Token reference in [Styling & Themes](docs/internals/styling-and-themes.md).
